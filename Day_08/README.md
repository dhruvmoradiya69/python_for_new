# OOPS in Python

# oops has 4 pillar
- Abstraction
-- hiding the implementation details of class and only show the essential features to the user

- encapsulation
-- data and functions into a single unit object 

- inheritance
-- it pass value one class to another class this called inheritance 

- polymorphism
-- same operator is allow to have diff meaning according to the context


- Explaining the concept of private entity in object-oriented programming

- Concept of private and public in Python classes

- Understanding private attributes and methods in classes

- Inheritance in OOP allows properties and methods to be passed from parent to child classes

- Learning about inheritance and the super method in OOP

- Static methods cannot access and modify class state but can be used for utility in Python

- Understanding the impact of class attribute changes on object attributes

- Understanding the three types of functions in OOP: static methods, class methods, and instance methods

- Calculating percentage of student marks using OOP

- Automatic updates based on attribute changes

- Understanding Polymorphism and Operator Overloading

- Operator overloading allows operators to have different meanings based on context

- Complex numbers have real and imaginary parts, which are added separately

- Creating a function to add complex numbers

- Operator overloading changes the meaning of operators for a class

- Creating a Circle class and defining constructor and methods

- Creating and using classes in Python with attributes and methods

- Separate logic for different data types in classes

- Last lecture will focus on project-oriented implementation
